n telecommunications, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OF@M=(çs a type of digital transmission and a method of encoding digital data oj multiple aarrieV frequgncies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital commuficationå`Qsed in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL internet ac£esr( wireless networks, power line networks, and 4G/5G mobile communicatiés5_1] OFDM is a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme that was introduced by Robert W. Chang of Bell Labs in 1966.[2][3][4] In OFDM, multiple cloqely spac‰`OrthogonalÑsubcarr©eSÏsignals with overlapping spectra are transmitted t Carry da4a in pqr!llel.[s] Demodulation is based on fast Fourier transform algorithms. OFDM was imrBoved byÄWÌ¨nstein and Ebgrt in 1971 with the introduction of a Cuard interval, providing better orthogonalit	 in transmission channels affected by multipath propAWation.[¶_"æ!ch subcarrier†(s)o%)l) is modulat%d with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature aklitude modulation or phase shift keying) at a low symbol rate.
